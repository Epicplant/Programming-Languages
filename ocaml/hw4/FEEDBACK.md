# HW4 Feedback questions

Approximately how many hours did you spend on this homework?
    Answer: About 16-20 hours

Any feedback about the lecture material corresponding to this homework?
    Answer: We REALLY should have gone over a bit of JSON in Ocaml before doing this assignment. Half of my struggle was just
    trying to find out how to do the JSON and there aren't a lot of good resources for learning it online.

Any feedback about the homework itself?
    Answer: Overall structure is ok, I appreciated being told what functions should be used in each question. The approximate number
    of lines that should be used is also a nice touch.

Anything else you want us to know?
    Answer: If we're going to be taught JSON, teach us JSON. Don't make us teach ourselves.
