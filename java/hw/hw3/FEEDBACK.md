# HW3 Feedback questions

(Optional): What new expression or binding did you add? Describe its syntax and semantics.
Answer: I didn't have enough time to do this sadly. This was a very big assignment and I had other homeworks

(Optional): What adversarial test did you write that points out an ambiguity,
corner case, or likely misbehavior? How would you fix this problem?
Answer: Didn't do this either as I didn't have the time. There were far too many things.

Approximately how many hours did you spend on this homework?
Answer: 25 hours is the minimum amount of time I spent although it's more likely that itw as 27-30 (This is just an approximation).

Any feedback about the lecture material corresponding to this homework?
Answer: In the future if this assingment is used again it would be a good idea to code part of it in class to give everyone
an idea as to all the functions that are available. Furthermore, it would allow students to ask questions easier
as Ed is not really a great way to ask questions (since it often takes an hour for a response).

Any feedback about the homework itself?
Answer: I understand that a lot of the points for this assignment are technically extra credit since we only need
to get 220 points to get an A for it, but there is far too much work and FAR too much ambiguity. It was fun, but
EXTREMELY stressful since there was so much work on top of my other assignments.

Anything else you want us to know?
Answer: I hope future assignments will be shorter ^_^;
