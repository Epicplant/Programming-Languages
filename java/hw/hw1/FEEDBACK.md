# HW1 Feedback questions

Approximately how many hours did you spend on this homework?
Answer: About 8 hours.

Any feedback about the lecture material corresponding to this homework?

Answer: I feel like the lecture on 3/28/2022 did a good job of setting us on
the right course; however, it is a bit odd that the first assignment is
in java when the course doesn't teach that language and it may have been
a while since people have worked with Java. As a result, maybe a bit more
java review is required although this is certainly not necessary.

Any feedback about the homework itself?

Answer: Overall everything is pretty clearly stated in the spec
so no feedback/complaints there; however, I would
appreciate being provided a lot more test cases on future assignments 
(even though I know part of this assignment is making your own tests).

Anything about your submission that is extra cool that we should be sure to check out?

Answer: Didn't have the time to make anything too exceptional this time around. I've been
very busy this week.
